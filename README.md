# CinemaKeeper
### Guess what? It's a Discord bot!

It'll control private voice-chat rooms on Discord server.

---
How I see it's behaviour:
1. Ya 'n ya boiz enter desired voice channel
2. One of you requests channel lock and bot sets user limit
3. Only initial members of channel can unlock it

## ⚠️ Only bot base implemented
The bot is now ready to run, but there is no command modules has been implemented
